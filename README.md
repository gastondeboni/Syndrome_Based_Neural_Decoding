# Syndrome-Based Neural Decoder
Implementation of model-free syndrome-based neural decoders.

## Disclaimer
The repository is still in progress. It may contain errors, so the interested user may have to get their hands a little bit dirty.

## Short summary
This repository contains a collection of works from different articles, some of them still unpublished (see Reference). Feel free to play around with the training and simulation parameters to either reproduce the results in the papers or produce your own. Some instructions are provided in SBND.py

## Packages needed
- Tensorflow
- matplotlib
- numpy
- commpy (for higher-order modulations)
- itertools (for sparsifying the parity-check matrix)
- maybe others...

## To train a Syndrome-Based Neural Decoder (SBND)
1) Download everything to a folder
2) Open the train_SBND.py file
3) Choose the training and simulation parameters
4) Run

## To test a decoder (either a trained one or a classic decoder)
1) Open test_decoders.py and follow the steps
